# A Rust client library for the Semantic Scholar API

This is a WIP.

You can check the Literature Graph Service (1.0) documentation at: <https://api.semanticscholar.org/graph/v1>.

## Acknowledgement

This crate iternal design was highly influenced by patterns implemented at the [gitlab crate](https://gitlab.kitware.com/utils/rust-gitlab). You can check Ben Boeckel's [blog post](https://plume.benboeckel.net/~/JustAnotherBlog/designing-rust-bindings-for-rest-ap-is) for some insight on those.

## Code review

It is recommended to always use [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev) to verify the trustworthiness of each of your dependencies, including this one.
